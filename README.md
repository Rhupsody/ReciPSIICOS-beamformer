  Distances:
	1.1 save_simulations_dist.m -- Generate simulations for different methods and different distances, the resulting activation maps saved at Z_totalDist.mat, and source locations in picked_src.mat
	1.2 plot_metrics_simulations_dist.mat -- calculate point spreading and bias for precomputed Z_total_full and picked_src and draw them on a graph

(Not cleaned yet)
  Correlations:
	2.1 save_simulations_dist.m -- Generate simulations for different methods and different correlations, the resulting activation maps saved at Z_totalDist.mat, and source locations in picked_src.mat
	2.2 plot_metrics_simulations_corr.mat -- calculate point spreading and bias for precomputed Z_total_G and picked_src and draw them on a graph
